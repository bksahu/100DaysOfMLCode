    "* Machine Learning is about mapping inputs (or features) to targets (or labels), which is done by observing many examples of input and target.\n",
    "* In neural networks the above is done via a deep sequence of simple data transformations (layer) which are learned by exposer to examples.\n",
    "* The specification of what a layer does to inpute data is stored in it's _weight_, which in essence are a bunch of numbers.\n",
    "* \"_Transformation implemented by a layer is parameterized by it's weight_\"\n",
    "* In this context learning means finding a set of values for the weights of all layers in a network.\n",
    "* A loss function is defined that basically tells us the deviation of the result form the true result.\n",
    "* This loss function can be used to calculate a Loss Score which using a Optimizer can be used as a to update the weight for the layers to perform better."
